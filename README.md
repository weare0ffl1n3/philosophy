Philosophy

We can sum up the offline philosophy in one line - “Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler.”

We believe in the power of simplicity, clarity, and frugality in design. Our philosophy is about keeping things simple, minimal, and usable, and we strive to make this the mainstream philosophy in the IT sector. The tendency for complex, error-prone, and slow software seems to be prevalent in the present-day software industry. We aim to prove the opposite by creating software that prioritizes simplicity and performance.

Our focus is on advanced and experienced computer users who are often underserved by mainstream software. We believe that this market is growing continuously, with users seeking solutions that match their unique work styles.

Designing simple and elegant software is far more difficult than adding unnecessary features that obscure the core purpose. However, the price of simplicity is worth it for the sake of reliability and maintainability. Minimalism results in reasonable and attainable goals, and we strive to maintain clarity to drive development to completion.

Manifest

Many developers mistakenly equate large amounts of code with progress, believing that the more lines of code they write, the more skilled they are. This is a delusion.

In reality, many developers care more about solving problems quickly than achieving quality. If something seems to work, it is often kept without regard for the structure or long-term sustainability of the code. This leads to bloated, hard-to-use software that becomes difficult to maintain.

Code complexity is the root of bloated, error-prone software. As complexity grows, performance suffers, and vulnerabilities arise. The only solution is to strip away the unnecessary and rebuild from scratch.

Quality rewrites are rare because developers often become attached to their complex code and pride themselves on their understanding of it. They believe that complexity is an ideal, and they resist simplification.

Ingenious ideas are simple. Ingenious software is simple. Simplicity is the heart of good software design. The fewer lines of code, the more progress you have made. The more you eliminate, the more your software improves.

Our Principles

We believe that true progress in software and design is rooted in intentional subtraction. To create something truly valuable, one must first refine and remove the unnecessary. The process of simplification allows clarity to emerge, ensuring that the core purpose of the software stands clear and undistracted.

This philosophy extends to our design approach—where minimalism is not merely a style, but a commitment to purpose. Each element, from code to user interface, serves a clear function, and nothing exists that does not contribute meaningfully to the experience. We believe that by reducing the extraneous, we make space for deeper engagement and greater focus. Function is prioritized over form, and the depth of experience is far more important than surface-level aesthetics or convenience.

We approach code as an art—one that values purity and clarity over complexity. A well-crafted line of code is clean, free of unnecessary dependencies, and easy to maintain. This approach ensures the longevity and sustainability of our projects, making them easier to extend and adapt as needs evolve.

Privacy and freedom are non-negotiable values. The software we create respects the user’s autonomy, protecting their data from unnecessary surveillance or distraction. We believe that software should be a tool for empowerment, not a means of control.

Elegance lies in restraint. True elegance is found not in adding, but in removing—the careful omission of the superfluous in favor of simplicity. Every feature, every line of code, should be intentional, and every decision made with purpose.

Finally, we build with timelessness in mind. The tools we create are designed to endure. They remain relevant and useful, not shaped by fleeting trends, but by the enduring needs of users who seek lasting solutions.
